    "**Description** - In this assignment, you will analyze the statistical properties of causal graphical models, and infer the effects of interventions using observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started** - You should complete the assignment using your own installation of Python 3 and the packages numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Download the assignment from Moodle and unzip the file. This will create a directory with this file, 'HW08.ipynb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables** - The assignment has a single deliverable: this jupyter notebook file saved as a pdf. Please answer all coding and writing questions in the body of this file. Once all of the answers are complete, download the file by navigating the following menus: File -> Download as -> PDF via LaTeX. Submit the downloaded pdf file on gradescope. Alternatively, you can save the file as a pdf via the following: File -> Print Preview -> Print as pdf.\n",

    "**Academic Honesty Statement** - Copying solutions from external sources (books, web pages, etc.) or other students is considered cheating. Sharing your solutions with other students is considered cheating. Posting your code to public repositories such as GitHub is also considered cheating. Any detected cheating will result in a grade of 0 on the assignment for all students involved, and potentially a grade of F in the course. \n",
